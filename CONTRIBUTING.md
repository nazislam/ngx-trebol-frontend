# Contributing Guidelines

So you want to help with the development of Tr√©bol? Thanks so much!
Please follow guidance as described in this file. These are not mandatory rules, but if you want your contributions to be accepted eagerly, it is better to follow them as good as you can.

__If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact [@bglamadrid (me)](https://github.com/bglamadrid) for it.__


## Where is help needed?

- [Try the live demo](https://trebol-ecommerce.github.io/ngx-trebol-frontend/), see if you have any suggestions or find anything wrong with it
- Improve existing documentation
  - Suggest or submit better contribution guidelines
  - This codebase is basically documented through JSDoc comments (and I've yet to polish them a little)
- See the _Issues_ section to find technical work that needs doing. Most of these are tasks are either to:
  - Write code to comply with newer REST API
    - Compare [the current frontend version](https://github.com/trebol-ecommerce/ngx-trebol-frontend/blob/main/package.json#L3) against [the current API version](https://github.com/trebol-ecommerce/ngx-trebol-frontend/blob/main/package.json#L3) and their respective changelogs
  - Add new client-side functionality
  - Improve user experience and accesibility
  - Find code worth improving, performance-wise or clarity-wise
- Translate the application to more languages; please read the [Angular guide on working with translation files](https://angular.io/guide/i18n-common-translation-files) so you know how to proceed


## Submitting issues

- Before submitting an issue, _please_ do search in the current issues list to prevent creating duplicates
  - Remember you can also join the discussion of an ongoing issue; if you have anything to say, _please_ don't hesitate
- Your issues should indicate __at least__ one of the following labels, and include certain basic information based on it:
  - `bug` - explain the expected behavior vs the resulting behavior; include a description of the procedure you used to replicate the problem
  - `feature` - explain the functionality that you wish to add
  - `enhancement` - explain the functionality you wish to improve, and what aspects should be improved
  - `tests` - try to submit one (1) unit test, or a group of mutually dependant unit tests, per issue
  - `refactor`, `documentation` or `i18n` - briefly explain the changes and/or additions you want to introduce
- Specificity is not a requirement, but __it is appreciated__
  - Include the expected outcome of working on the issue, or an approximation
  - Declare some steps to be followed: if possible, try to divide your issue into a logical sequence of tasks
  - Indicate the use case you're expecting to cover, such as "clicking the login button when the user has not typed their password in"
- Use markdown to your advantage
  - Adding some headings help a lot in structuring your text so it's easier for everyone to read


## Working on issues

- If you want to to work on an issue, request that it is assigned to you beforehand.
- If you are assigned to, and for some reason can't or don't want to go on with something, be it an issue or a pull request, please let me know. It's okay to stop and  take breaks when necessary. But most importantly, transparency and honesty in these matters are appreciated.


## Submitting pull requests

- Make sure you describe your changes in the `CHANGELOG.md` file
  - Try to keep it simple and concise.
  - __Do not__ add excessively technical info about the changes, like filenames or line numbers.
  - If you need to do that, you can add comments within the GitHub web interface.
  - You can give yourself authorship of your changes.
