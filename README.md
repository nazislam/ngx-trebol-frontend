# TrÃ©bol e-Commerce Angular Frontend

A single-page web application designed and developed over Angular v13.3, RxJS and Material Design.

## Current status

Supporting [TrÃ©bol API v1.5.0](https://github.com/trebol-ecommerce/api/releases/tag/v1.5.0).

Important features in this version of the API include three new paths that can be called to announce status changes for sales:

- `POST /data/sales/confirmation` - When the payment is accepted, and the contents are ready to be delivered to the customer
- `POST /data/sales/rejection` - When any problem is found, the contents cannot be delivered and the customer must be refunded
- `POST /data/sales/completion` - When the contents were delivered to the customer, indicating the sell was successful

Fake API implementation is included to preview this functionality as well.

## Features

### Live Demo

[Visit the application live demo in this link](https://trebol-ecommerce.github.io/ngx-trebol-frontend/).

To access all the features, click on the button with an user icon in the top right corner of the screen. Then type `admin` for both the username and password fields. This will trigger a session state change, affecting the aforementioned button, and allowing you to see an user menu where you can navigate to the management module.

#### Mock data

This demo is powered by a feature module that provides data stored in hard-coded JS arrays; this means that your browser's working memory acts as a fake and volatile persistence layer. You can try all CRUD-related functionalities as you'd expect, but if you force a reload or leave the application, all changes in data will be lost.

At scale, I interchangeably call this the "fake API" and the "local-memory module". In both cases I mean the same thing.

All (most of the) mock data was created using [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/).

### Infrastructure

The application itself is divided into modules in the `/src/app/` directory, and its structure is as follows:

- `store/` most of the public-facing components; there's the frontpage aka the product catalog, the checkout page, and the receipt page
- `management/` the administrative area of the app: there you register, update and categorize products; create users; list customers; upload images, etcetera
- `shared/` exports components, directives, and other stuff that is used by other modules, and the application as a whole
- `api/` contains interfaces, modules, and dependency injection tokens to interact with [the backend REST API](https://github.com/trebol-ecommerce/api)
  - `local-memory/` serves a fake API basically running in the browser itself; it's the default option to build and serve with; and the demo uses it too
  - `http/` serves the API with HTTP calls; these require a real, running backend with an exposed REST API compliant to the specification linked above

The `api` module is [imported through an environment file](#configuring-the-build--serve-process) to easily switch between implementations.

### Internationalization

This project uses [Angular i18n features](https://angular.io/guide/i18n-overview); this means you can build the app using different languages. Currently bundled locales reside in `/src/locales`. There are three:

- `en-US`
- `es`
- `es-CL`

If you wish to translate this frontend to another language, check out [this Angular guide on working with translation files](https://angular.io/guide/i18n-common-translation-files).

## Getting started

### Requirements

- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) v13 or higher, and a compatible [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) installation.

### How to use

1. Clone this repo, using `git clone` or your preferred GUI tool for Git
2. Execute `npm ci` in the root directory (where `package.json` resides)
3. Execute `ng s` or `ng serve` in the root directory to preview-run the application. This is equivalent to visiting the live demo linked above.
4. To work with a backend, you should set up your working environment.

#### Testing

Unit test suites run using Jasmine. The steps to make them run are simple:
Execute `ng t --no-watch --browsers={browser}` in the root directory to test the entire application inmediately, only once.

When developing/hacking though, you might find it better to have the app run tests whenever you change any part of the code (like `ng serve` does). To do that instead:
1. Execute `ng t` or `ng test` in the root directory to simply start the Karma server.
2. Connect to its listening address (e.g. `localhost:9876`) with your browser.
3. In the root directory, under a different process, execute `karma run`. OR you can press the `DEBUG` button in the browser window, to initiate the test suites in debug mode.

#### Configure the build / serve process

- Make yourself comfortable with the [official guide on Building and Serving Angular Apps](https://angular.io/guide/build).
- Default environment files already exist in `/src/environments/`
  - `environment.ts` defines variables
  - `environment-modules.ts` defines module dependencies
- The `/src/angular.json` file contains some additional configs; I mostly use `staging`, `localhost` and `production`. The latter two require you to define environment files as specified by their `fileReplacements` definitions.
  - There's also a configuration for each bundled locale other than default `en-US`.
  - You can use more than one configuration, but some of the definitions will collide. Please do have a look at them before trying to use them.
- This project also declares the [angular-cli-ghpages plugin](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages#options) as a devDependency, which you may find useful to deploy to a GitHub Pages environment like in the live demo.


#### Quick configuration steps

1. Create a copy of the two environment files and rename them accordingly from your desired configuration e.g. `environment.localhost.ts` and `environment-modules.localhost.ts`.
2. Call `ng s` or `ng b` Angular CLI command using the `-c` option to target said configuration e.g. `ng b -c production`. You can target more than one, separating them by commas `,`.
3. If you used `ng b`, serve the files from your preferred webserver. I often do `php -S localhost:80` from the resulting `./dist/ngx-trebol-frontend/` directory. If you use any of the above mentioned locales you'll have to either:
  A) mind the corresponding subdirectory
  B) remove, comment or change the value of the `<base>` tag in the generated `index.html`
