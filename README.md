# TrÃ©bol e-Commerce Angular Frontend

A single-page web application designed and developed over Angular v11, RxJS and Material Design.

You can view the demo in action [in this link](https://trebol-ecommerce.github.io/ngx-trebol-frontend/). Served data is stored in JS arrays, that is, it is loaded into and from your browser's working memory. That also means said data is reset once you refresh the page.
To access the management pages, proceed to the login dialog clicking on the button in the top right corner. Then type `admin` for both the username and password fields.

## Current status

Supporting [the currently released API version (v1.2.2)](https://github.com/trebol-ecommerce/api/releases/tag/v1.2.2)

## Infrastructure

The application itself is divided into modules in the `/src/app/` directory, and its structure is as follows:

- `store/` most of the public-facing components; there's the frontpage aka the product catalog, the checkout page, and the receipt page
- `management/` the administrative area of the app: there you register, update and categorize products; create users; list customers; upload images, etcetera
- `shared/` exports components, directives, and other stuff that is used by other modules, and the application as a whole
- `api/` contains interfaces, modules, and dependency injection tokens to interact with [the backend REST API](https://github.com/trebol-ecommerce/api)
  - `local-memory/` serves a fake API basically running in the browser itself; it's the default option to build and serve with; and the demo uses it too
  - `http/` serves the API with HTTP calls; these require a real, running backend with an exposed REST API compliant to the aforementioned one

Since implementation of the `api` module can vary, it is not directly imported by the `app` module, but must be imported through an environment file. See section "Configuring the build / serve process" for more details.

## Requirements

- An [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) 11-compatible [Node.js/NPM](https://nodejs.org/) installation.

## Getting started

`git clone` this repo, then do `npm install` in the root directory.

## Testing

This project runs on top of Jasmine, try them out with `ng test` in the root directory.

## Internationalization

This project uses [Angular i18n features](https://angular.io/guide/i18n-overview); this means you can build the app using different languages. Currently bundled locales are located in `/src/locales`:

- `en-US`
- `es`
- `es-CL`

If you wish to translate this frontend to another language, check out [this Angular guide on working with translation files](https://angular.io/guide/i18n-common-translation-files).

## Configuring the build / serve process

- The default environment files already exist in `/src/environments/`
  - `environment.ts` defines variables
  - `environment-modules.ts` defines module dependencies
- The `/src/angular.json` file contains two base configuration definitions that you can use: `production` and `localhost`. There's also configurations for each bundled locale mentioned above. Create configuration files as you see fit.
- Make yourself comfortable with the [official guide on Building and Serving Angular Apps](https://angular.io/guide/build). Basically, you need to create a copy of the environment files, rename them following the pattern for your desired configuration, and call the `serve` or `build` Angular CLI command with the `-c` option in order to target said configuration.
- Remember you can use multiple build configurations in the same command, separating them by commas (e.g. `ng build -c production,es`).
- You can also use the [angular-cli-ghpages plugin](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages#options) to automate your deployment.
